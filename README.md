# Jet.com API library

While this is still in development, all of the Authentication and Product API calls are complete and working.

Bulk uploads now work - merchant sku's tested, need to test the other types.

Orders Api is working

The source is completely documented, so you can generate the Javadoc.

There is a makeshift test set up in the Main class, see that for usage for now.  

Yes, I will be writing tests for everything...
